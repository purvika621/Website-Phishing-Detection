# Website Phishing Detection

A **Cognitive Computing project** that detects phishing websites using **Machine Learning techniques**. The project focuses on analyzing website features and classifying them as *legitimate* or *phishing*, helping protect users from online fraud.

## üöÄ Features

* Extracts and processes features from website data.
* Implements multiple **ML algorithms** (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Decision Trees).
* Provides accuracy comparison across models.
* Visualizes results with plots and metrics.
* User-friendly Jupyter Notebook for experimentation.
